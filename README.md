# Emergency Vehicle Detection using YOLO and LSTM
The Emergency Vehicle Detection System offers an integrated approach to emergency vehicle detection and classification by combining visual and auditory analysis. YOLOv8 excels in identifying emergency vehicles within the video stream, while the LSTM model specializes in the classification of audio cues. This multi-modal approach ensures a higher level of accuracy, reliability, and comprehensiveness, making it a powerful tool for emergency services, traffic management, and public safety applications. The system's real-time capabilities and efficiency further solidify its position as a valuable asset in the field of public safety and emergency response.
